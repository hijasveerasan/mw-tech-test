/*
This package is required to provide functionality to read the supplied customer_data.csv file
and return a sorted data structure of your choice containing email domains along with the number of
customers for each domain. Any errors should be logged (or handled) or returned to the consumer of this package.
Performance matters, the sample file may only contains 1K lines but it could be 1m lines or run on a small machine.
